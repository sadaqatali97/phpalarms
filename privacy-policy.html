                                may have "sold" or "shared" about you. For the 12-month period prior to the date of this
                                Privacy Policy, PHP Alarms has only sold or shared Personal Information about its
                                customers as described in this Privacy Policy. PHP Alarms does not use or disclose
                                sensitive Personal Information, as defined in applicable laws, for any purposes other
                                than those permitted by applicable law.</p>

                            <p>We may offer programs such as contests, surveys or other similar promotional campaigns
                                (collectively, "Promotional Campaigns"). In exchange for participating in our
                                Promotional Campaigns and providing us with your Personal Information, such as your name
                                and contact information, we may offer you financial incentives and/or price or service
                                differences such as a discount or a coupon. You can terminate participation at any time
                                as explained in the applicable Promotional Campaign terms. We estimate that the value of
                                the Personal Information we collect for Promotional Campaigns is the value of the
                                benefit we offer to you in connection with the promotion, which is reasonably related to
                                the costs associated with offering such benefit. </p>
                            <h3>7. RETENTION PERIOD</h3>
                            <p>We will retain your information for no longer than is reasonably necessary to provide you
                                services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
                                agreements. The criteria used to determine our retention periods includes: (a) the
                                length of time we have an ongoing relationship with our customers and provide services,
                                (b) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, and (c) whether
                                retention is necessary to support our legal position (such as in regard to applicable
                                statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</p>
                            <p>For example, we retain all videos for a maximum of 30 days unless you grant us specific
                                permission to retain them. We retain the original audio from calls for a maximum of 6
                                months and retain transcripts from calls for a maximum of 6 months. </p>

                            <p>The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting the Site from outside the

                                the United States or other countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The data
                                protection and other applicable laws of the United States or these other countries may
                                not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise
                                differ from the data protection or consumer protection laws in your country. Your
                                Personal Information may be available to government authorities under lawful orders and
                                law applicable in such jurisdictions. By using the Site and/or providing Personal
                                Information to us, you consent to transfer of your Personal Information as described in
                                this Privacy Policy.</p>
                            <h3>9. CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS</h3>
                            <p>Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in the United States or other
                                jurisdictions where PHP Alarms and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and service
                                providers operate. These locations are required to operate with redundancies.</p>
                            <p>If we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we
                                use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts with standard contractual clauses
                                published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914 and
                                the international data transfer addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual
                                Clauses version B.1.0 issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office and laid before
                                Parliament in accordance with s119A of the Data Protection Act 2018 on 2 February 2022,
                                as it is revised under Section 18 of the UK Addendum.</p>
                            <p>In addition, PHP Alarms certifies to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it
                                complies with the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and more specifically the EU-U.S. Data
                                Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) Principles, which apply to the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK
                                Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF)
                                Principles, which apply to the Swiss-U.S. These lay out a set of requirements governing
                                participating organizations' use and treatment of personal data received from the
                                European Union and, as applicable, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), as well as the
                                access and recourse mechanisms that participants must provide to EU and, as applicable,
                                UK individuals. The Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles likewise lay out a set of requirements
                                governing participating organizations' use and treatment of personal data received from
                                Switzerland, as well as the access and recourse mechanisms that participants must
                                provide to Swiss individuals. Once an organization publicly commits to comply with the
                                DPF Principles, that commitment is enforceable under U.S. law.</p>
                            <p>To the extent that PHP Alarms has responsibility for the processing of personal data
                                it receives under DPF and makes an onward transfer to a third party acting as an agent,
                                processor, or sub-processor, PHP Alarms may remain liable under DPF, unless the
                                recipient processes such personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF.</p>
                            <p>If this Privacy Policy conflicts with applicable DPF Principles, the DPF Principles will
                                govern and the rest will remain in effect.</p>
